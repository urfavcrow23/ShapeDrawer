<h2 align="left"><b>Shape Drawer</b></h2>

  <i> 
  <img src="https://github.com/urfavcrow23/QuizApp/blob/main/Images/eyes_1f440.gif?raw=true" width="19"> Is a Python script that utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application for drawing shapes and displaying their coordinates using Matplotlib. The application consists of three main windows: a splash screen, a window for DDA Line Drawing, and a window for drawing various shapes.
1. Splash Screen:
The splash screen is displayed at the beginning of the application.
It uses Tkinter for GUI elements and includes two buttons for users to choose between two options.
The options lead to separate windows for DDA Line Drawing and Shape Drawing.

2. DDA Line Drawing Window:
This window allows users to input coordinates (X0, Y0) and (X1, Y1) for a line.
Upon clicking a button, it calculates and displays the points on the line using the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm.
Matplotlib is employed to create a plot of the line, and the coordinates are displayed in a graphical user interface.

3. Shape Drawing Window:
This window allows users to draw various shapes (lines, rectangles, circles) on a canvas.
Shapes are drawn based on user input and displayed on a grid.
A dropdown menu enables users to select the type of shape they want to draw.
A Treeview widget is used to show a list of drawn shapes along with their coordinates.
The GUI is responsive to mouse events, facilitating the drawing of shapes through click and drag actions.


4. Main Window:
A main window with a customized loading animation is displayed before opening the splash screen.
The loading animation includes an image transition and provides a visual indication that the application is loading.
After the loading animation, the splash screen is launched.

<h4 align="left">  <i> 

1. Custom Loading Animation:
A loading animation is displayed in the main window before opening the splash screen.
The animation involves transitioning between two images, providing a visual indication of the loading process.

2. GUI Customization:
The GUI is customized with a specific color scheme and font choices.
The application window can be resized and has specific positions on the screen.

3. Image Handling:
Images are used for background and buttons in the GUI, loaded using the PhotoImage class from the Tkinter library.
Image transitions are part of the loading animation.

4. Responsive Design:
The GUI elements are positioned dynamically based on the screen size, making the application somewhat responsive.

5. Code Structure:
The code is organized into functions, each responsible for a specific window or functionality.
Classes are used for encapsulating related functionality, such as the ShapeDrawer class.

6. Integration of Libraries:
Tkinter is used for creating the GUI.
Matplotlib is integrated for plotting graphs within the Tkinter window.

7. Exit and Transition:
The script ensures proper termination of windows using destroy() and mainloop() methods.
There is a smooth transition from the main window to the splash screen.
